Title: Analyzing the Impact of Situational Factors on Car Accidents: Towards Safer Roads with Autonomous Vehicles

Description:
The continuous increase in population, vehicles, and drivers has made driving an essential aspect of modern life. As software and hardware technologies continue to advance, businesses strive to automate their processes and products. This pervasive computerization brings both advantages and disadvantages that significantly influence our lives.

In this research project, we investigate the data pertaining to car accidents in the United Kingdom over a span of 16 years. Our study focuses on analyzing how situational factors contribute to these accidents. Despite the decreasing accident rate in the UK, which can be attributed to improved road conditions, the advent of autonomous vehicles has the potential to further reduce this number.

Employing regression algorithms, we meticulously analyze the accident statistics to shed light on the role of human error as a prominent factor in traffic accidents. By integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into automobiles, we aspire to enhance safety and mitigate accident occurrences, leading to a safer and more secure way of life.

However, it is crucial to address the ethical implications that arise from adopting technologies like AI and the Internet of Things (IoT). This research paper delves into the significant ethical concerns associated with the integration of AI and IoT in vehicles, fostering a comprehensive discussion on the subject.
